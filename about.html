<p class="bio">
    I was born in the Russia and spent my childhood on
    <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.056257,158.643941&z=3&output=embed" target="external-frame">
    the Kamchatka Peninsula</a>,
    a remote region in the Far East. I studied in School with accelerated education program.
    When I was 14, I moved to
    <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=54.697328, 20.494295&z=4&output=embed" target="external-frame">
    Kaliningrad</a>,
    which is on the opposite side of Russia. My new home turned out to be far away from ex one.
    I finished school with excellent grades, could win some Olympiads,
    and received numerous <a href="portfolio/1.school_achievements.pdf" target="external-frame">awards</a>.
    I excelled in my final exams and was <a href="portfolio/2.letter_of_thanks_from_governor.pdf" target="external-frame">commended by the governor</a>.

    At 18, I enrolled in the <a href="https://en.spmi.ru/" target="_blank">Mining University</a>
    of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=59.929192, 30.269365&z=10&output=embed"
    target="external-frame">St. Petersburg<a/>. I studied Oil and Gas Engineering.
    I continued to take part in physics and <a href="portfolio/3.ITMO_Math_diploma.pdf" target="external-frame">math</a> competitions.
    While studying at the university, I decided to take a programming course as
    an extracurricular activity. By that time, I had experience in programming
    in Pascal and C (obtained in school). I always approached programming without
    enthusiasm, but I was always good at writing code. So, I decided to try
    programming in Python. That was the moment that changed my life. Attempting to
    engage in programming as a hobby, rather than a mandatory discipline, has shown
    me how truly fascinating it can be.
    I easily passed <a href="portfolio/4.Python_course_MU.pdf"
    target="external-frame">this course</a>.

    After finishing my second year, I decided to transfer to another
    university to continue my IT development and devote more time
    to it. I have applied to the <a href="https://www.emu.edu.tr/en" target="_blank">Easter Mediterranean University</a> in
    <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.129135, 33.917347&z=3&output=embed" target="external-frame">Cyprus<a/>. As a result, I am currently studying computer science. I am
    learning C, SQL, and Web programming. Moreover, I continue to learn
    Python. Furthermore, I have become interested in Data Science and am
    now studying this field. I am most interested in the field of Machine
    Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
